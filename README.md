# Routing simulation for PDGRL

* This program is for the simulation of Bai Liu's work *Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Control of Queueing Systems*.

* Users could just modify the parameters in `Main.m` and execute it. Other files are assistant functions and need not be executed or changed.

* This program is not designed to be open source. So sometimes the comments might be insufficient. If you have any question, feel free to contact `bailiu@mit.edu`.
